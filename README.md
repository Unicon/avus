Avus Testing Framework
======================

Avus is a WebSSO authentication testing framework based on the Geb framework.

The name Avus is an acronym for "airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow", which is a reference to the Monty Python and
the Search for the Holy Grail scene where the bridge keeper fails his own tests not knowing the difference between the
European swallow and the African swallow.
